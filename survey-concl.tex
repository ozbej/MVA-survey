\chapter{Concluding Remarks}

\label{chap:Concl}



This survey reviewed multiple popular MVA approaches and some of the most
popular MVA software tools.

Most of the MVA tools provide support for importing custom datasets. This
is detrimental for data analysis, as most users need to analyze their
custom datasets. Most MVA tools also support brushing and linking, which
allow users to interact with a visualization and explore data in greater
depth and see how the data points or regions of interest are related to
other variables in the dataset. Some tools also provide support for manual
grouping (which is useful for preparing and labeling data for ML models),
and automated clustering. Most popular MVA views in the reviewed tools
are: scatter plot, scatter plot matrix, parallel coordinates, and
similarity map. Other views are not as important and are not as widely
used.

Of the reviewed tools, High-D offers the most functionality. However, it
is available only as a paid software. The best freely available software
is mVis, which offers most important views and features for MVA tools.
